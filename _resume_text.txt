Supervisor: Dr. Sruti Das Choudhury (Offer Letter)
- Co-authored a human-centered XAI study that combined k-means/hierarchical clustering, SHAP-driven interpretability, and
narrative visualization to turn a 22-crop agronomic dataset and a 500-record/6-variable hospital-cost cohort into 4 actionable
clusters (e.g., crop regimes sized 797/618/585/200), demonstrating how rescaling/categorical handling improves cluster trust-
worthiness for decision-making.
- Built an interactive visual-analytics pipeline on UNL greenhouse phenotyping data (42 plants, 9 genotypes, 25 days) that cou-
ples temporal embeddings, DTW-based clustering, and SHAP/LIME-linked causal views, achieving ARI=0.30 and NMI=0.62
genotype–cluster agreement while enabling “early prediction” analysis via accuracy-vs-day curves.
- Engineered HyperProbe, a lightweight Streamlit-based human-in-the-loop hyperspectral tool spanning 517-1700 nm (243
bands) that integrates pixel/ROI selection, derivative + spectral-angle analytics, Otsu band-difference segmentation, interac-
tive MLP/LR/RF classification, clustering, and PCA/t-SNE embeddings into a single end-to-end workflow.
- Featured in the university’s news story snr.unl.edu (August, 2025).

- Developed and benchmarked FH-FAM, a fuzzy-hypergraph feature-selection algorithm for high-dimensional agriculture &
remote-sensing data, achieving 81.43% mean classification accuracy with 89.28% mean feature reduction across 15 public
datasets, outperforming multiple established baselines.
- We propose SIF-HFAM, a strong intuitionistic fuzzy hypergraph framework equipped with a monotone submodular coverage
objective. The method admits the classical greedy (1 −1/e)-approximation guarantee and achieves an average accuracy of
approximately 78% while removing ∼98% of the features (retaining < 2%) across 14 high-dimensional benchmark datasets,
all with favorable computational runtime.

Projects
Geodesic optimal transport (Transfer Geometry) | GitHub
Implemented sliced-Wasserstein OT diagnostics on frozen ResNet-18 features and benchmarked across 48 transfer settings
(CIFAR-10/STL-10/SVHN), showing strong correlations with zero-shot transfer (Pearson r ≈−0.71) and low-data adaptation
speed (Spearman ρ ≈0.60 at 200-shot).
Grokking + LoRA (Low-Rank Tax) | GitHub
Built controlled modular-addition experiments (p=97) comparing full-parameter vs. LoRA-on-frozen-base training for 15k
epochs, reproducing classic grokking in the full MLP (99% train @ 288 →99% val @ 481) and quantifying rank/LR thresholds
(e.g., r=8 fails to fit; r=16 reaches high acc without 99% val within budget).
Volatility-Scaled AdaGrad (Online Learning) | GitHub
Implemented VS-AdaGrad, a CPU-efficient drift-aware online optimizer that scales AdaGrad using discounted residual volatil-
ity; on piecewise AR(5) non-stationary series (5 regimes, T ≈5000, 10 seeds), reduced regret proxy vs. AdaGrad by 18.4%
(small drift) and 19.8% (medium drift) and outperformed tuned OGD by 23.7–63.8% across drift regimes.
